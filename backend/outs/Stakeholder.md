Introduction for the Project: Overview, Objectives, and Rationale

The Contacts Management System project aims to design and develop a comprehensive system for managing and organizing contacts across the organization. The project is driven by the need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of existing manual processes, reduce data inconsistencies, and enhance collaboration among teams.

The primary objective of the project is to create a centralized, user-friendly, and scalable contacts management system that meets the needs of various stakeholders, including sales, marketing, customer service, and management teams.
